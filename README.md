# Adaptive Noise Cancellation using Normalized LMS Algorithm
The main objective of the noise cancellation is to estimate the noise signal and to subtract it from original input plus noise signal and hence to get the noise free signal. There is an alternate method called adaptive noise cancellation for estimating a sign corrupted by an additive noise or interference. Adaptive filtering may be a wide area of researcher in present decade within the field of communication. As received signal is continuously corrupted by noise where both received signal and noise signal both changes continuously, then this arises the necessity of adaptive filtering. This method uses a primary input that contains an analog (chirp) signal having random input and a reference input containing noise. The reference input is adaptively filtered and subtracted from the first input to get the estimated signal. In this method the specified signal corrupted by an additive noise are often recovered by an adaptive noise canceller using LMS (least mean square) algorithm. This adaptive noise canceller is beneficial to enhance the S/N ratio. This project is built in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment using Normalized LMS algorithm.
